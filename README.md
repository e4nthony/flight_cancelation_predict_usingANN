# Flight cancelation prediction using AI.

This is my Final project at "Artificial Intellgence" course.

This project implements two approaches: 'Artificial Neural Network' and 'K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm' to predict is flight going to be canceled in next day as cause of present weather conditions at that day.



Project built on Windows OS, using python version 3.10.
